# Turtlebot_Mapping
- **State machine with the turtle, the evolution in the program there are two ways to operate the robot manually or automatically. If the manual way is chosen, it can be controlled from the keyboard, but with the automatic way there are two missions, the first is to move three points from a preset map on the map and the second mission is to return to the entry point (start). All through a state machine for control and asynchronous processes such as obstacle detection with point cloud and robot movement.**
